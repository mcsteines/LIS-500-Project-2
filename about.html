                            <h4>Who I Am</h4>
                            <p>
                                I'm pursuing a dual major in Economics and Information Science. 
                                This unique combination allows me to explore how data, systems, and human behavior 
                                intersect in our increasingly digital world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm deeply interested in the ways technology shapes society, particularly in areas 
                                like artificial intelligence, product management, and the ethical implications of 
                                digital innovation. My goal is to work at the intersection of technology and social 
                                impact, creating products and systems that are not only functional but also equitable 
                                and inclusive.
                            </p>

                            <h4>My Interests</h4>
                            <p>
                                My passion for technology extends beyond coding and algorithms. I'm fascinated by how 
                                technological decisions impact real people's lives, especially those from marginalized 
                                communities. Through my studies in economics, I've learned to analyze systems and 
                                incentives. Through information science, I've learned how information flows, how 
                                interfaces shape behavior, and how design choices can either reinforce or challenge 
                                existing inequalities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm particularly drawn to product management because it sits at the 
                                nexus of technology, business, and human needs. Product managers must balance technical 
                                feasibility with user experience and business objectives, but I believe they also have a 
                                responsibility to consider equity and social impact in every decision.

                            <h4>Reflection from Project 1</h4>
                            <p>
                                Working on Project 1 was an eye-opening experience that challenged many of my assumptions 
                                about bias and fairness. Before this course, I understood bias primarily as an individual 
                                problem—something that "bad people" had. But through our readings and discussions, I've 
                                come to understand that implicit bias is far more pervasive and subtle.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the most striking realizations was recognizing how my own background influences my 
                                perspectives on technology. As someone interested in AI and product development, I had to 
                                confront how easily bias can be embedded in algorithms and design choices, often 
                                unintentionally. The systems we build reflect the assumptions and blind spots of their 
                                creators, which is why diverse perspectives in tech are not just a nice-to-have but a 
                                necessity.

                            <p>
                                My understanding of intersectionality has deepened through both academic study and 
                                personal experience. Growing up, I witnessed how different aspects of identity—race, 
                                class, education level, and nationality—interact in complex ways to shape people's 
                                opportunities and experiences.

                                    A person's access to technology isn't just about income, it's also shaped by their 
                                    geographic location, language background, educational system, and cultural context. 
                                    Someone might have the financial means to buy a computer but lack the support systems 
                                    or educational background to use it effectively.

                                As I continue my studies and prepare for a career in technology, I'm committed to 
                                bringing these insights with me. Whether I'm building AI systems, managing product 
                                development, or making strategic decisions, I want to ensure that equity and inclusion 
                                are central considerations, not just afterthoughts.

                                Hi! I'm Matt Steines. I am a senior here at UW-Madison in my final semester. I am 
                                getting a degree in Information Science with a certificate in Data Science. 
                                My coursework has varied from machine learning, to statistical modeling to learning about 
                                data visualization with Tableau. I hope to take my well-rounded degree and find a job that 
                                suits my skillset well.

                                As a kid I was always very interested in tech, and felt that studying it and its

                                varied so I'm excited to see what's out there.

                                My experience with data science has given me a strong foundation in understanding how 
                                information systems work and how data shapes our digital world. Through courses in:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Machine Learning: Understanding how algorithms learn from data and make predictions</li>
                                <li>Statistical Modeling: Building models to analyze patterns and relationships in data</li>
                                <li>Data Visualization (Tableau): Creating clear, compelling visual representations of complex data</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                These skills have prepared me to approach problems analytically while keeping the human 
                                element in understanding that behind every dataset are real people and real stories.

                            <h4>Reflection from Project 1</h4>
                            <p>
                                I learned a lot about internal bias, specifically with how we perceive the different 
                                fields (Liberal Arts vs. Sciences). The test itself wasn't overly impactful as much as 
                                the thoughts I had while taking it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What surprised me the most was the realization that even as someone who sees themself as an open minded individual, 
				I carry unconscious biases that influence how I interpret 
                                information and make decisions. By realizing this, I can hopefully have more objective viewpoints
                            </p>

                                    The process of examining my own biases, especially those based around academic disciplines and 
                                    how we value different types of knowledge has allowed me more to be more conscious of the need to 
                                    approach problems from multiple perspectives. Technical skills are clearly important, but so 
                                    is understanding the broader social context in which technology operates.

                                I plan to apply both the hard skills and soft skills I've learned here at UW to maximize 
                                my potential in any role I take. Regardless of whether or not these soft skills actually 
                                apply directly to a specific job, I feel they are vastly important for my overall 
                                experience as a student and working person.

                                My diverse coursework in machine learning, statistics, and data visualization, combined 
                                with the critical thinking skills developed in courses like this, has prepared me to 
                                contribute meaningfully to creating technology that serves everyone equitably.

                        Together, we bring alternative but complementary perspectives to understanding technology's role in society. 
                        Wuziyang's focus on economics and product management, combined with Matt's expertise in data 
                        science and machine learning, allows us to approach problems from both strategic and technical 
                        angles.                    </p>

<!-- we found our secondary focuses(data science/economics) provided us with a relatively unique experience when speaking about this -->
                        <p> 
                            As the next generation of technologists, we have both the opportunity and responsibility to shape 
                            how technology evolves. Through an educational focus on social knowledge on top of our technical skills, we can create a technological future that includes and benefits all.
