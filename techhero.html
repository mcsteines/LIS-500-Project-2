                    <h3>Biography</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Timnit Gebru is an Ethiopian-American computer scientist and a leading voice in the movement 
                        for ethical artificial intelligence. She is the founder and executive director of the Distributed 
                        Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR), an independent, community-rooted AI research 
                        institute. Before founding DAIR, she was a co-lead of Google's Ethical AI team, where she conducted 
                        groundbreaking research on algorithmic bias and fairness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Born in Ethiopia, Dr. Gebru immigrated to the United States as a teenager during the Ethiopian 
                        Civil War. She earned her undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University 
                        and later completed her PhD in computer vision and machine learning at Stanford's Artificial 
                        Intelligence Laboratory. Her doctoral research focused on using computer vision to study diversity 
                        and socioeconomic indicators in urban environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout her career, Dr. Gebru has been a pioneering researcher at the intersection of AI, 
                        ethics, and social justice. She co-authored the influential "Datasheets for Datasets" paper, 
                        which proposed documentation standards to improve transparency and accountability in AI systems. 
                        She also co-founded Black in AI, a community organization supporting Black researchers in the 
                        field of artificial intelligence. Her work has consistently challenged the tech industry to 
                        confront how AI systems can perpetuate and amplify existing societal inequalities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Gebru's departure from Google in 2020 sparked widespread discussion about corporate 
                        accountability, academic freedom, and the treatment of researchers who raise concerns about 
                        AI ethics. She has since become an even more prominent advocate for independent AI research 
                        and for centering the voices of marginalized communities in technology development. Through 
                        DAIR, she leads research that examines AI's impacts on communities often left out of mainstream 
                        AI discourse.

                    <h3>Impact on Equity in Technology</h3>
                    
                    <figure class="content-image">
                        <img src="image/equity-in-technology-term-image.webp" 
                             alt="Team of diverse researchers collaborating on technology project"

                        <figcaption>Building diverse teams and independent research institutes creates pathways for more equitable AI development</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    
                    <p>
                        Dr. Gebru's impact on equity in technology extends across multiple dimensions of race, class, 
                        and gender. Her research has fundamentally changed how the tech industry and academic community 
                        think about algorithmic bias and fairness. One of her most cited papers, co-authored with Joy 
                        Buolamwini, demonstrated that commercial facial recognition systems have significantly higher 
                        error rates for women and people with darker skin tones—with Black women experiencing the 
                        highest error rates. This research provided concrete evidence of how AI systems can embed and 
                        amplify racial and gender bias, leading several companies to reassess their facial recognition 
                        technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond her research, Dr. Gebru has been instrumental in creating institutional change. Through 
                        Black in AI, she has built a global community that provides mentorship, networking, and support 
                        for Black researchers who have historically been underrepresented in the field. The organization 
                        hosts workshops, scholarships, and conferences that make AI research more accessible to Black 
                        students and professionals. This work addresses the class and educational barriers that have 
                        limited diversity in AI, recognizing that equity requires not just calling out problems but 
                        actively creating pathways for those who have been excluded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her advocacy extends to examining the labor practices and power dynamics within the AI industry. 
                        Dr. Gebru has highlighted how large language models and AI systems often rely on low-paid data 
                        workers, many from the Global South, who label and clean datasets under difficult conditions. 
                        She has also critiqued the environmental costs of training massive AI models, which 
                        disproportionately impact lower-income communities and countries. This intersectional analysis 
                        connects issues of race, class, and global inequality, showing how AI development can exploit 
                        and harm marginalized communities even as it promises progress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through DAIR, Dr. Gebru is pioneering a new model for AI research, one that is independent from 
                        corporate interests and rooted in community needs. This approach challenges the concentration 
                        of AI research power in a few wealthy tech companies and creates space for research questions 
                        that might not serve corporate profits but are crucial for social justice. Her work demonstrates 
                        that achieving equity in technology requires not just diverse representation, but fundamental 
                        changes to who controls research agendas, who benefits from technological advances, and whose 
                        voices shape the future of AI.

                <section class="hero-section">
                    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Timnit Gebru represents a new generation of technologists who refuse to separate technical 
                        excellence from social responsibility. As AI becomes increasingly central to our lives, 
                        her vision for community-centered, ethical AI development offers a crucial alternative to 
                        old-standard approaches that have historically marginalized Black communities, women, and 
                        other groups facing systemic discrimination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For students and professionals entering the tech field, Dr. Gebru's example shows that it is 
                        possible to be both technically excellent and deeply committed to justice. Her career path 
                        reminds us that real change often requires taking risks, speaking uncomfortable truths, and 
                        building alternatives rather than simply critiquing existing systems. In a field that often 
                        celebrates disruption in business but resists disruption of social inequalities, Dr. Gebru 
                        stands as proof that technology can and must do better.
