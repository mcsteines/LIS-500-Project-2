                    <figure class="content-image">
                        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559757148-5c350d0d3c56?w=1200&q=80" 
                             alt="Abstract visualization representing hidden unconscious thoughts and biases" 
                             loading="lazy">
                        <figcaption>Implicit biases operate beneath our conscious awareness, influencing our perceptions and decisions</figcaption>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Implicit bias</strong> refers to the attitudes, stereotypes, and associations we hold 
                        about different groups of people that operate automatically and unconsciously. Unlike explicit 
                        bias (prejudice we're aware of), implicit biases happen without our conscious awareness or 
                        intentional control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These biases develop over a lifetime of exposure to cultural messages, media representations, 
                        and social experiences. Even people who consciously reject stereotypes and value equality can 
                        harbor implicit biases that contradict their stated beliefs. This doesn't make someone a "bad 
                        person."It makes them human, living in a society with a long history of inequality and stereotyping.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Key Characteristics of Implicit Bias:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Automatic:</strong> These associations happen quickly and unconsciously</li>
                        <li><strong>Universal:</strong> Everyone has implicit biases, regardless of their conscious values</li>
                        <li><strong>Malleable:</strong> While persistent, implicit biases can be reduced through awareness and practice</li>
                        <li><strong>Impactful:</strong> They can influence our decisions, behaviors, and interactions in subtle but significant ways</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Where Do Implicit Biases Show Up?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Implicit biases can affect many areas of life, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hiring decisions and workplace evaluations</li>
                        <li>Educational settings (teacher expectations, grading, discipline)</li>
                        <li>Healthcare (diagnosis, treatment recommendations, pain management)</li>
                        <li>Criminal justice (arrest decisions, sentencing, jury deliberations)</li>
                        <li>Everyday social interactions and snap judgments</li>

                    <figure class="content-image">
                        <img src="image/intersectionality.png"

                        <figcaption>Intersectionality recognizes how different aspects of identity overlap and interact</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Intersectionality</strong> is a framework for understanding how different aspects of 
                        a person's identity; such as race, gender, class, sexuality, disability, and age interact and 
                        overlap to shape their unique experiences of privilege and discrimination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term was coined by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989. She observed that Black women 
                        faced discrimination that was different from what Black men or white women experienced—it wasn't 
                        just racism plus sexism, but a unique form of discrimination that arose from the intersection 
                        of these identities.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Why Intersectionality Matters:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Intersectionality teaches us that people's experiences can't be understood by looking at just 
                        one aspect of their identity. For example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A working-class white woman faces different challenges than an upper-class white woman or a working-class Black woman</li>
                        <li>A gay man of color experiences both racism and homophobia, but in ways that are distinct from straight men of color or white gay men</li>
                        <li>A disabled person's experience varies significantly based on their race, class, and gender</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Intersectionality in Everyday Life:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Understanding intersectionality helps us recognize why a "one-size-fits-all" approach to equity 
                        often fails. Different groups need different supports and interventions because their challenges 
                        arise from different combinations of systemic barriers. It also helps us avoid creating hierarchies 
                        of oppression or assuming that all members of a group have identical experiences.

                <!-- Personal reflection section on taking the IAT -->
                <section class="resource-section" id="iat-reflection">
                    <h3>Reflection on the Implicit Association Test (IAT)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Taking the Implicit Association Test was a challenging and humbling experience. The IAT measures 
                        the strength of automatic associations between concepts (like race or gender) and evaluations 
                        (like good or bad) or stereotypes (like athletic or intellectual).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What struck me most was how quickly and automatically these associations operate. Even when I 
                        consciously tried to override them, the test revealed patterns I wasn't fully aware of. This 
                        doesn't mean the results define who I am or predict how I'll behave in every situation, but it 
                        does highlight how deeply ingrained societal messages can be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The experience reinforced several important lessons. First, awareness is the first step toward 
                        change, we can't address biases we don't acknowledge. Second, having implicit biases doesn't make 
                        someone a bad person, but ignoring them or refusing to work on them can lead to harmful outcomes. 
                        Finally, reducing bias requires ongoing effort and practice, not just a one-time realization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Taking the IAT also made me more compassionate, both toward myself and others. Recognizing that 
                        these biases are part of being human in an imperfect society helped me approach the issue with 
                        curiosity rather than shame, and commitment rather than defensiveness.

                    <h3>Taking Action</h3>
                    <p>
                        Learning about implicit bias and intersectionality is just the beginning. Here are some ways 
                        to continue your growth:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Practice self-reflection and notice when biases might be influencing your thoughts or decisions</li>
                        <li>Seek out diverse perspectives and experiences different from your own</li>
                        <li>Challenge stereotypes and biased statements when you encounter them</li>
                        <li>Support organizations and initiatives working toward equity and inclusion</li>
                        <li>Continue educating yourself through reading, courses, and conversations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Remember: understanding bias and working toward equity is a lifelong journey, not a destination. 
                        Be patient with yourself and others, stay curious, and remain committed to growth.
